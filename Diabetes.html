	<h2>Diabetes Overview</h2>
	Diabetes is a number of diseases that involve problems with <span style=color:orange>the hormone insulin</span>. Normally, <span style=color:green>the pancreas (an organ behind the stomach) releases insulin to help your body store and use the sugar and fat from the food you eat</span>. Diabetes can occur when the pancreas produces <span style=color:orange>very little or no insulin</span>, or when the body does not respond appropriately to insulin. As yet, there is no cure. People with diabetes need to manage their disease to stay healthy.
	<h2>Early Signs and Symptoms of Diabetes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Hunger and Fatigue</li>
		<li>Peeing more often and being thirstier</li>
		<li>Dry mouth and itchy skin</li>
		<li>Blurred vision</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
	<ul>

<li><span style=color:orange>Yeast infections</span>. Both men and women with diabetes can get these. Yeast feeds on glucose, so having plenty around makes it thrive. Infections can grow in any warm, moist fold of skin, including:
Between fingers and toes
Under breasts
In or around sex organs</li>
<li><span style=color:green>Slow-healing sores or cuts</span>. Over time, high blood sugar can affect your blood flow and cause nerve damage that makes it hard for your body to heal wounds.</li>
<li><span style=color:orange>Pain or numbness in your feet or legs</span>. This is another result of nerve damage</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms of Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style=color:orange>Unplanned weight loss</span>. If your body can't get energy from your food, it will start burning muscle and fat for energy instead. You may lose weight even though you haven't changed how you eat.</li>
<li><span style=color:green>Nausea and vomiting</span>. When your body resorts to burning fat, it makes ketones. These can build up in your blood to dangerous levels, a possibly life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Ketones can make you feel sick to your stomach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms of Gestational Diabetes</h2>
High blood sugar during pregnancy usually has no symptoms. You might feel a little thirstier than normal or have to pee more often.

<h2>Warning Signs of Diabetes Complications</h2>
<span style=color:green>Signs of type 2 diabetes complications may include</span>:
<ul>
<li>Slow-healing sores or cuts</li>
<li>Itchy skin (usually around the vaginal or groin area)</li>
<li>Frequent yeast <</li>
<li>Recent weight gain</li>
<li>Velvety, dark skin changes of the neck, armpit, and groin, called acanthosis nigricans</li>
