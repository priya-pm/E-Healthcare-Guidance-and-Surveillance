	<h2>What is Covid 19</h2>
	A coronavirus is a kind of common <span style=color:green>virus</span> that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
	In early 2020, after a<span style=color:orange> December 2019 outbreak in China</span>, the World Health Organization identified <span style=color:orange>SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus</span>. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.

     COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger<span style=color:green> what doctors call a respiratory tract infection</span>. It can <span style=color:orange>affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs)</span>.

    It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through <span style=color:green>person-to-person contact</span>. Infections range from mild to deadly.

    SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.

    <h2>Is there more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2?</h2>

It’s normal for a virus to change, or mutate, as it infects people. A Chinese study of 103 COVID-19 cases suggests the virus that causes it has done just that. They found<span style=color:orange> two strains</span>, which they named L and S. The S type is older, but the L type was more common in early stages of the outbreak. They think one may cause more cases of the disease than the other, but they’re still working on what it all means.
